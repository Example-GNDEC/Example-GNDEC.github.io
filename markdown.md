# Markdown Language Overview

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text. It is designed to be easy to read and write, making it ideal for writing content that will later be converted to HTML or other formats. Here are the key points about Markdown:

## Basic Syntax
- **Headings**: Use `#` for headings. For example, `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, up to `###### Heading 6`.
- **Bold**: Enclose text with `**` or `__`. For example, `**bold text**`.
- **Italic**: Enclose text with `*` or `_`. For example, `*italic text*`.
- **Lists**: Use `-`, `+`, or `*` for unordered lists. Use numbers for ordered lists.
- **Links**: Use `[link text](URL)` for links.
- **Images**: Use `![alt text](image URL)` for images.
- **Blockquotes**: Use `>` for blockquotes.
- **Code**: Enclose inline code with backticks `` `code` ``. Use triple backticks for code blocks.

## Extended Syntax
- **Tables**: Use pipes `|` to create tables. Align text using colons `:`. 
- **Task Lists**: Use `- [ ]` for tasks. Use `- [x]` for completed tasks.
- **Footnotes**: Use `[^1]` for footnotes and `[^1]: Footnote text.` to define them.
- **Strikethrough**: Use `~~strikethrough~~` for strikethrough text.
